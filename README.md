# biome-config

This is an opinionated, well-defined Biome configuration to help you get started with your project. ~~It currently is the configuration used by [Stacks.js](https://stacksjs.org).~~ We are using [Pickier](https://github.com/stacksjs/pickier) at the moment.

## Features

- Preconfigured linter & formatter settings
- Customizable TypeScript, JavaScript, JSON & CSS rules
- Automatic import organization
- EditorConfig support enabled by default
- Git integration
- Predefined ignore patterns for common files/directories

## Get Started

```bash
bun i @stacksjs/biome-config
```

After you installed the config, you need to extend it in your `biome.json` file.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json",

  // add your custom configuration here

  "extends": ["@stacksjs/biome-config"]
}
```

_You want to tweak some of the rules? You can easily override them._
